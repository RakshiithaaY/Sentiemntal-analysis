Twitter Sentiment Analysis Project

The project aims to classify Twitter tweets into sentiment categories: positive, negative, and neutral. Sentiment analysis is crucial for understanding public opinions, monitoring trends, and improving decision-making processes for businesses and individuals.

Dataset
The dataset comprises 5000 tweets, with the following structure:
tweet_id: Unique identifier for each tweet.
tweet_content: The actual text content of the tweet.
sentiment_label: The manually assigned sentiment label (positive, negative, neutral).

1. Data Preparation and Preprocessing
Loading Data: The dataset is imported as a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.
Handling Missing Data: Any null values are identified and removed to ensure data consistency.
Text Preprocessing: Each tweet undergoes preprocessing steps such as:
Lowercasing text.
Removing URLs, mentions, hashtags, special characters, and numbers.
Tokenizing words (splitting sentences into individual words).
Removing stopwords (e.g., "the", "and", "is") for clearer sentiment analysis.
Lemmatizing words to reduce them to their base forms.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Sentiment Distribution: Bar charts to visualize the count of each sentiment category.
Word Clouds: Highlight the most frequent words in positive, negative, and neutral tweets.
Tweet Length Analysis: Distribution of tweet lengths to identify patterns.

3. Feature Engineering
Text Vectorization: The text data is converted into numerical representations using:
TF-IDF Vectorizer: Captures the importance of words in each tweet relative to the dataset.

4. Model Training and Evaluation
Five machine learning models were used to classify tweets into sentiment categories:

Logistic Regression
A simple and interpretable algorithm for binary/multiclass classification.
Strength: Fast and effective for smaller datasets.

Random Forest Classifier
An ensemble model using multiple decision trees.
Strength: Handles non-linear relationships and avoids overfitting to some extent.

Support Vector Machine (SVM)
A robust algorithm for text classification with linear and non-linear kernels.
Strength: Excellent for high-dimensional data like text.

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
A non-parametric algorithm that predicts based on the majority class of the nearest data points.
Strength: Simple to understand and effective for small datasets.

Gradient Boosting Classifier
A boosting algorithm that builds multiple weak learners sequentially to minimize errors.
Strength: Handles complex patterns and outperforms on structured data.
Popular Variant: XGBoost or LightGBM for faster computation.

5. Evaluation Metrics
The models were evaluated using the following metrics:

Accuracy
